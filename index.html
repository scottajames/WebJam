    <div class="aboutText">
    	<p>The presence of African elephants helps to maintain suitable habitats for many other species. In central African forests, up to 30 percent of tree species may require elephants to help with dispersal and germination. They play a pivotal role in shaping their habitat because of the enormous impact they have on factors ranging from fresh water to forest cover.</p>

  	<div class="wwd1"><img src="elephant_sanctuary.jpg"><h3>Elephant sanctuary</h3><p>We hope one day there will be no need for such sanctuaries, until then we provide a safe protected area for all animals.</p></div>
  	<div class="wwd2"><img src="elephant_ivory.jpg"><h3>Closing ivory market</h3><p>Entire elephant populations are being slaughtered, as international criminal syndicates profit from the demand for ivory.</p></div>
  	<div class="wwd3"><img src="elephant_hospital.jpg"><h3>Veterinary care</h3><p>Mobile veterinary units are critical to provide health care for captive and wild elephants for emergency rescue.</p></div>

  	<div class="missionTitle"><h2>Our mission</h2></div>
  	<div class="missionText"><p>To reduce the illegal trade in elephant products, we support antipoaching efforts within and around protected areas. We also work to establish new protected areas to provide safe havens for elephants. We work with TRAFFIC, the world’s largest wildlife trade monitoring network, to assess trends in the illegal trade in elephant products. This includes implementing the CITES Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) which monitors and tracks elephant ivory seizures.

    <div class="help1">
      <h3>Give in celebration</h3><p>Whether it’s a birthday, wedding or other milestone moment, support the African elephant at your special occasion. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="help2">
      <h3>Donate from will</h3><p>We couldn't do what we do without the support of people who leave us a legacy – in fact, gifts in wills make up about a fifth of all our donated income.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="help3">
      <h3>Adopt an elephant</h3><p>The magnificent elephant is under threat; around 47 African elephants are killed a day for their tusks. Key populations are in decline due to poaching and a shrinking habitat.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="help4">
      <h3>One-off donation.</h3><p>Following a one-off donation of £25, you will receive a super-soft plush toy, fun facts about elephants, and a certificate you can personalise to celebrate their support,  all delivered in a beautiful environmentally friendly box. We’ll also keep you updated about how your support is helping when we can.</p>
